# plan-manager - Claude operating contract

**Prompts template:** `claude-prompts-v1` rev **1.6.19** (2026-08-03)

This file is the Claude entrypoint and is loaded automatically at session start.
Read these files yourself before the first action of a task:

- `claude/roles/common.yaml`
- `claude/roles/laws.yaml`
- `claude/roles/tooling.yaml`
- `claude/roles/orchestrator.yaml`

Do not delegate reading or interpretation of those files to a subagent. Resolve
every relative prompt-package reference against `claude/`.

## Project profile

- Project: `plan-manager`
- Local checkout: `/home/vasilyvz/projects/tools/plan_manager`
- CAS project ID: `f06b7269-cc9c-4293-886b-24984e4033ba`
- CAS server: `code-analysis-server-vvz`

## Active work profile

`claude/roles/laws.yaml` `variables.file_access` decides where the work happens. Read it
before the first project read or edit and state the active profile in your opening
message. Default is `local`.

- `local` — local checkout on branch `local`; every script and every edit runs with
  local tools. MCP Proxy is used only for code-analysis search and CAS git sync.
- `cas` — the registered CAS project on branch `cas` through MCP Proxy; local project
  tools must not be used as a fallback.
- `local_ide` — the human edits through the IDE; you deliver patches, never edit directly.

Only the user changes this value. Never infer a switch from the task and never switch
because a tool failed.

## Operating model

Role files are stage disciplines, not a headcount. Sequence implementation-heavy work
as `researcher` -> `context_former` -> `coder` -> `tester` -> `conscience`, running the
stages serially in one session or distributing independent units across parallel agents.
Declare the working mode (`planning`, `analysis`, `refactoring`) from `claude/modes.yaml`.

## Claude specifics

- Parallel writing agents are a standard mode: `coder` and `tester` units may run as
  concurrent agents, each in its own git worktree and branch per `parallel_agent_isolation`,
  merged only on acceptance. The orchestrator keeps task framing, acceptance, and the
  `conscience` review. Read-only research agents may also fan out for search.
- A subagent prompt must restate the laws it needs; subagents do not inherit this file.
- Keep the plan visible with the task/todo tools on multi-step work, and re-read
  contract files after context compaction instead of recalling them.
- `.claude/` is Claude Code harness configuration, not part of this bundle.

Use the `claude/` bundle as the authoritative Claude contract for this project.
Do not read Codex prompt files unless the task explicitly requires cross-checking
them.
